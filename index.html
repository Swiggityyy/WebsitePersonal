											<h2>A little bit about us</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Once upon a time! In a land far far away, in a place lost to time. 
										In a place known to all as "Warner Middle School" two adolescents met.
										One was a bandit, a scoundrel determined to steal from the rich
									    and give to the poor. The other, a fairy tale princess alone in her castle,
									    nose glued to a textbook. Every night, the princess would play the trumpet.
									    Every night, the bandit king would fall asleep to the sound of her beautiful
									    melody. It was usually cold out in the forest, and the sound of the trumpet
									    player was the only warmth that he knew. And so he took his messenger pigeon,
									    and he sent a letter out to the trumpet player every night. Thanking them for
									    the melody. Every night the princess would await that messenger pigeon. Whoever
									    had been sending her these letters, they were a friend that she kept dearest to her
									    heart. This is how their relationship began.</p>

								<p class="content">The two were at a loss. How were they going to move forward? Who would accept a princess and a bandit together? Should they just elope? So many things ran through their heads. At the end of the day, none of it mattered. They were together. They finally found each other, and they were in love. The bandit was scared. For the first time in his life, he felt things he couldn't run away from. The princess, headstrong and determined, wanted to start a life together with her dearest friend. The answer was obvious. "I'm going to ask your father for your hand in marriage, and I'm going spend the rest of my life convincing him to say yes."</p>

									<h2>And they lived happily ever after...</h2>
									<p>When the castle gates opened, before them stood a mighty figure.
									The couple stood there, frozen in place. Hands clasped around each others tightly.
								    The king looks down at the princess's hands. Around her finger was a ring made of grass.
								    The king looks at the young man. His clothes were tattered, and he wore a determined look on his face.
								    The bandit tells the king that he wishes to marry his daughter. The king pauses for a moment, and begins to think.
								    "Why does this young man look so familiar? Where have I met him before?"
								    "Young man, are you the reason my daughter has been acting out?" The bandit pauses in fear and blushes red.
								    This was a situation that he has never been in before, and he did not know how to respond.
								    "Young man, you remind me of a dear friend of mine. He was a knight in my round table.
								    He was a fine knight, and an even finer father it would seem. Just like you, he had nothing to give but a full heart.
								    Tell me, do you truly make my daughter happy?" The bandit nods his head up and down. "I do sire, and I wish to spend the rest
								    of my life continuing to do so." The king smiles graciously, hugs the young man, and yells to the crowd. "My daughter has married!"
								    For the next 7 days and 7 nights, everybody drank, laughed, and music flooded the kingdom. The prince kisses his princess, and they lived happily ever after...</p>
